# Coessentiality_DepMAP_FLVCR1
Co-essentiality Analysis for FLVCR1 (DepMap CRISPR 23Q2). 

# System requirements

The code was tested in MacOS Ventura. 
The code was run in R (4.3.1). Additional packages required is tidyverse (Version used was 2.0.0). 

# Installation 

Install the required library with the function install.packages() in R. The data is available on DepMAP repository. The estimate time for installation of the required packages should not exceeed 3-5 minutes.

# Demo/Instructions 

The demo code is identical to the real data. The file that includes essentiality scores from DepMAP should be placed in the directory. Then, the provided code can be run. The expected output is a .csv file that includes all the co-essentiality scores between FLVCR1 and other genes. The expected time may vary between 20-30 min.
